# Test Cases
- Add ideas for test cases (Used for Test Driven Dev)
- Example
- 1)check the number of flight attendants based on the number of passengers (1 flight attendant per 50 passengers )
- flight attendence = ceiling(passengers/50)--->so GBR-10 aircraft has 1 flight attendant and NU-150 aircraft could have 1 or 2 flight attendants. ex 51 passengers in  NU-150 aircaft needs 2 flight attendants.
- 2)check GBR-10 aircraft has at most 45 passengers and NU-150 aircraft has at most 75 passengers. (this might sparated to two tests).
